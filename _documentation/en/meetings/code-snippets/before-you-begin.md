# Before You Begin

## What are Code Snippets?

Code snippets are short pieces of code you can reuse in your own applications.
The code snippets use code from [example repositories](https://github.com/topics/nexmo-quickstart).

Please read this information carefully, so you can best use the code snippets.  

## Prerequisites

#### Vonage Developer Account

If you don’t have a Vonage account yet, you can get sign up for one here: [Vonage Developers Account](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sign-up?icid=tryitfree_api-developer-adp_nexmodashbdfreetrialsignup_nav).

#### Meetings API Activation

To activate the Meetings API, you need to register with us. Please send an email request, with your API key from the [Vonage API Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com), to the [Meetings API Team](mailto:meetings-api@vonage.com).

#### Application ID and Private Key

Once you’re logged in to the [Vonage API Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com), click on Applications and create a new Application. Generate a public and private key and record the private key.

#### JSON Web Token (JWT)

JWTs are used by the Meetings API to authenticate your requests. Use the [JWT Generator](https://developer.vonage.com/jwt) to create a JWT using the Application ID and Private Token mentioned above.

For further details about JWTs, please see [Vonage Authentication](/concepts/guides/authentication).
