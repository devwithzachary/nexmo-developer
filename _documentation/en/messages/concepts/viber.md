# Understanding Viber messaging

Viber Business Messages can only be sent by businesses that have been approved by Viber. This business profile will also have a green check to indicate that it is a legitimate business.

The advantage of Viber Business Messages is that the identifier of users on the platform is their mobile phone number. You can use Viber Business Messages with branded rich content and a Two Way account which enables both inbound and outbound messages. You can share important updates and notifications, promotional content with new offers and services, and provide customer support.

In order to get started with Viber Business Messages you will need to email [api.sales@vonage.com](mailto:api.sales@vonage.com). Vonage is an official partner and will handle the application and creation of your Viber Business Messages account for you.

If successful, your account manager will provide you with a Viber Business Messages ID. This ID can only be used on Vonage.
