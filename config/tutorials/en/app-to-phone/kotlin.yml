    # Introduction
    In this tutorial, you will learn how to create an Android application using Kotlin and the Nexmo Android Client SDK, and then write the code to make a phone call from your Android app to a phone.

    Two parts are needed to achieve this:

    * An Android application that will make the voice call using the Client SDK.
    * A publicly accessible URL that serves instructions on how to handle the call. To accomplish this, you will create a webhook server using <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Node.js</a>, <a href="https://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express</a> and <a href="https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel" target="_blank">localtunnel</a>.

    ### Completed project
    If you would like to follow along without building the app yourself, the completed project is available on [Github](https://github.com/nexmo-community/client-sdk-tutorials) -  please see the [app-to-phone-kotlin](https://github.com/nexmo-community/client-sdk-tutorials/tree/main/app-to-phone-kotlin) folder.

    # What's next?

    The complete version of the project you just built is available on [Github](https://github.com/nexmo-community/client-sdk-tutorials) -  please see the [app-to-phone-kotlin](https://github.com/nexmo-community/client-sdk-tutorials/tree/main/app-to-phone-kotlin) folder.

    You can do a lot more with the Client SDK:
    - read the [Client SDK documentation](/client-sdk/overview)
    - review the [Android Client SDK documentation](/sdk/stitch/android/index)
    - try the [Client SDK Android Samples](https://github.com/nexmo-community/client-sdk-android-samples) repository
